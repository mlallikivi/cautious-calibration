# Cautious Calibration in Binary Classification

This repository holds the code for the methods used in the article [Cautious Calibration in Binary Classification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05120) by M-L. Allikivi, J. JÃ¤rve and M. Kull (2024).


The example of how to generate data and how to learn different cautious (and regular) calibration maps on it can be found in [example.ipynb](./src/example.py).
